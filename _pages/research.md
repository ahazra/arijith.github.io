Below are some key areas of my current research:

## Scientific Machine Learning and Deep Learning-Based Inversion

A significant aspect of my research focuses on deep learning-based approaches for solving inverse problems, particularly with applications in Geophysics and Mechanical Sciences. My current efforts are directed toward developing Bayesian inversion techniques using deep learning, which offer a probabilistic framework for handling uncertainty and improving the interpretability of results.

By combining advanced machine learning techniques with domain-specific knowledge, my work addresses challenging problems such as subsurface imaging, material characterization, and structural health monitoring. This line of research represents the intersection of scientific machine learning and computational science, opening avenues for robust, data-driven problem-solving methods.

## Higher-Order Numerical Scheme Development for Computational Electrodynamics (CED)

Another core area of my research involves developing advanced numerical methods for computational electrodynamics. I am currently working on finite volume time domain (FVTD) and discontinuous Galerkin time domain (DGTD) schemes for time-domain electrodynamics. These methods are designed to possess highly desirable properties such as low dissipation, low dispersion, and energy preservation, ensuring accurate and efficient simulations of electromagnetic wave propagation.

Leveraging this expertise, I am also exploring broader areas of computational wave propagation and computational magnetohydrodynamics, which present exciting challenges and opportunities for advancing simulation techniques in applied physics and engineering.

## PhD Work: Dynamic MRI and Image Reconstruction

During my PhD, I collaborated with an interdisciplinary team of scientists to advance MRI technologies. My thesis focused on the numerical modeling, simulation, and experimental validation of dynamic MRI, with a particular emphasis on fluid flow imaging. To achieve this, I developed a GPU-enabled code in C++ that significantly enhanced simulation efficiency.

Although I am no longer actively engaged in this field, I retain a deep interest in algebraic image reconstruction and related inverse problems. These topics continue to inspire ideas for potential collaborations, and I hope to revisit them with suitable partners in the future.
